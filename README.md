The home page is the main page which the customer see’s on first clicking on the website URL. The home page briefly showcases the different products available on the website.
The common elements you’ll see throughout the website are the Navbar and the Footer.

3. The cart logo will take us to the cart page.
4. The checkout logo will take us to the checkout page.
5. Below the Kohl’s logo we can see the Shop by Category tab.

Shop by Category ta
Here we can click on a particular category which we want to shop for, and the website will show only the items of that category. Here, we used sorting to sort the items according to category.

The Footer
The footer consists of all the helpful links required by the customer. Also it includes the links for social media handles of the company as well as the mobile app of Kohl’s. We used anchor tags for the links.
After first visiting the website the customer will create an account and sign-in to shop from the store.
Create Account Page

Create Account page
The user will fill in all the required data and the data will be pushed into a local storage item which will be helpful while authenticating the user while sign-in.

Sign-in page
The sign-in page takes user input and checks if the customer is an existing user by validating the information from the local storage item. Also the page has a section which leads to create account page, if the user is new.
After signing in the user will start shopping. For demo we’ll go to the Men’s clothing section.

The product view page will show the selected product, also it will show the product description as we scroll down the page. The back button on the left upper corner will take us back to the section we previously came from.
In this page we can view the product properly, select the size we want, add or reduce the quantity of the product, and finally if we wish to buy the product we can add the product to the cart using add to cart button. Adding to cart will push the information of the object into a local storage item which will be accessed by the cart page.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Cart page
In the cart page all our selected products appear. You can increase or decrease the quantity of the product or remove the product using delete button. The right half of the page shows the total number of items and tax to be applied and gives the total amount to be paid.
Now for buying the products we have to go to the checkout page.
